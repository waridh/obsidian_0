# Getting started with OCaml

## Installation

### Package Manager

OCaml has an official package manager called **`opam`**. It lets you switch between OCaml versions and also much more. You can deal with different projects that are using different versions of OCaml.

#### Switch

**`opam`** introduces *switch* which is an isolated environment that contains the OCaml compiler with a set of OCaml packages. Think of python pip environments.

### Windows Installation Process

The windows installation is done through the Diskuv OCaml (DKML) installer.
