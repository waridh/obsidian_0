## 4.1.1 Modules

A block of hardware with inputs and outputs is called a *module*. AND gates, multiplexers, and a priority circuit are all hardware modules. There are two methods of describing module functionality:
1. *behavioural* - What the module does
2. *structural* - How it is built from simpler pieces. An application hierarchy.

Modules in SystemVerilog acts a lot like functions. You define your inputs and outputs, and then you write the logic inside of it.
