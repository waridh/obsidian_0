# Overview

SPL-5 is the first SAS protocol to support both 8b10b encoding and 128b150b encoding. This shift in encoding allows the previous data transfer rate to be effectively doubled to 24Gbit/s in 8b10b but physically only running the physical link with a transfer rate of 22.5Gbit/s.

## SAS introduction

Storage and communication protocol used in server storage solutions. A good comparison would be the SATA protocol.
