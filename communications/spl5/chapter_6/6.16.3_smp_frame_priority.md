# SMP Frame Priority

SMP frame priority is used by an expander device to prioritize OPEN address frames with the SAS protocol field set to SMP.

If an expander PHY or a SAS PHY supports SMP frame priority, then that PHY shall set the SMP PRIORITY CAPABLE bit to one in the IDENTIFY address frame.

SMP frame priority is enabled on expander PHY or a SAS PHY that:
1. sets the SMP PRIORITY CAPABLE bit to one in the IDENTIFY address frame; and
2. receives an IDENTIFY address frame with the SMP PRIORITY CAPABLE bit set to one.
