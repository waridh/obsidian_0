# Expander Logical Phy Arbitration Requirements

An expander logical PHY will set its request path request High Priority argument to one when the expander logical PHY requests a path after:
1. The expander logical PHY has forwarded an OPEN address frame to the logical link;
2. The expander logical PHY receives an OPEN address frame with higher arbitration priority; and
3. The destination SAS address and connection rate of the received OPEN address frame are not equal to the source SAS address and connection rate of the transmitted OPEN address frame.
Otherwise the logical PHY shall set the higher priority argument to zero

(You should look at the XL state machine [6.19]())
