# Overview

SAS protocol initiates a connection by opening a connection between the initiator port and the target port, followed by establishing a connection between the PHY in those ports.
- The SSP initiator ports open SSP connections to transmit SCSI commands, tasks management functions, and transfer write data. The SSP target port opens SSP connections to transfer read data, request write data, and transmit service responses.
- SMP initiator port opens SMP connections to transmit SMP requests and receive SMP response.
- STP initiator ports and STP target ports open STP connections to transmit SATA frames. An STP target port in an expander device
