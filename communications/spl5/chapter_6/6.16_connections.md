# Overview

SAS protocol initiates a connection by opening a connection between the initiator port and the target port, followed by establishing a connection between the PHY in those ports.
- The SSP initiator ports open SSP connections to transmit SCSI commands, tasks management functions, and transfer write data. The SSP target port opens SSP connections to transfer read data, request write data, and transmit service responses.
- SMP initiator port opens SMP connections to transmit SMP requests and receive SMP response.
- STP initiator ports and STP target ports open STP connections to transmit SATA frames. An STP target port in an expander device
- The OPEN address frame is used to request that a connection can be opened.
	- AIP primitive sequences, OPEN_ACCEPT, and OPEN_REJECT are the responses to the OPEN address frame.
- BREAK primitive will either cancel a connection request, or just abort the connection.
- CLOSE primitive is used for proper closure of the connection.
- Connections use a single pathway, from the SAS initiator to the SAS target, and while a connection is opened, only one pathway will be used for that connection.
	- For STP connections, the SATA device are never aware of the SAS connection management
- A wide port may have a separate connection in each of it's logical PHYs
