# Overview

SAS supports least-recently used arbitration fairness for connection requests.

# Description

- Each SAS port and expander port shall include an an Arbitration Wait Time timer that counts the time from the moment when the port makes a connection request until the request is accepted or rejected.
- The Arbitration Wait Time timer is in the port layer state machine ([7.2.2]()).
- The Arbitration Wait Time timer shall count in microseconds from 0 us to 32 767 us and in milliseconds from 32 768 us to 32 767 ms + 32 768 us. The Arbitration Wait Time timer shall stop incrementing when its value reaches 32 767 ms + 32 768 us.

## Starting Arbitration timer
- SAS port starts the arbitration timer when it transmit the first OPEN address frame for the connection request.
- When the SAS port retransmit the OPEN address frame (likely from losing arbitration and handling an inbound OPEN address frame), it will set the ARBITRATION WAIT TIME field to the current value of the Arbitration Wait Time timer. <!-- Why does it need to know this??-->
- A SAS port should set the Arbitration Wait Time timer to zero when it transmits the first OPEN address frame for the connection request. <!-- Makes sense, it's the initial connection request-->
- A SAS initiator or SAS target port may be unfair by setting the ARBITRATION WAIT TIME FIELD in the OPEN address frame to a higher value than its Arbitration Wait Time timer actually indicates.
	- Restriction is that the unfair SAS port will not set the ARBITRATION WAIT TIME field to higher or equal to 8000h.

### Expander

1. When an expander port receives and OPEN address frame, it will also set the Arbitration Wait Time timer to the value of the incoming ARBITRATION WAIT TIME field.
2. Then, it will start the Arbitration Wait Time timer as the expander port arbitrates for internal access to the outgoing expander port.
3. When the expander device transmits the OPEN address frame out another expander port, it shall set the outgoing ARBITRATION WAIT TIME field to the current value of the Arbitration Wait Time timer maintained by the incoming expander port

### SAS port policy

- A SAS port shall stop the Arbitration Wait Time timer and set the Arbitration Wait Time timer to zero when the SAS port has no more frames to send.
- A SAS port shall stop the Arbitration Wait Time timer and set it to zero when the SAS port receives one of the following connection responses:
1. OPEN_ACCEPT;
2. OPEN_REJECT (PROTOCOL NOT SUPPORTED);
3. OPEN_REJECT (ZONE VIOLATION);
4. OPEN_REJECT (RESERVED ABANDON 1, [2 & 3]);
5. OPEN_REJECT (STP RESOURCES BUSY); or
6. OPEN_REJECT (WRONG DESTINATION); <!-- Essentially when the initiate connection process is over between the initiator and the target. -> Source and destination PHY. -->
- On OPEN_REJECT (RETRY), OPEN_REJECT (RESERVED CONTINUE 0), or OPEN_REJECT (RESERVED CONTINUE 1) is received:
1. If the CONTINUE AWT bit is set to 1 in the Protocol Specific Port mode page (9.2.7.4), then a connection response of OPEN_REJECT (RETRY), OPEN_REJECT (RESERVED CONTINUE 0), or OPEN_REJECT (RESERVED CONTINUE 1) will not stop the Arbitration Wait Time timer and shall not set the Arbitration Wait Time timer to zero. <!--Because these OPEN_REJECT will try to get the opening connection process to continue-->
2. if the CONTINUE AWT bit is set to 0, then the SAS port will stop the Arbitration Wait Time timer, and set it to 0.
- A SAS port should not stop the Arbitration Wait Time timer and set the Arbitration Wait Time timer to zero when the SAS port receives an incoming OPEN address frame that has priority over the outgoing OPEN address frame according to table 179, regardless of whether the SAS port replies with an OPEN_ACCEPT or an OPEN_REJECT. <!--So I guess that the arbitration process will continue when a PHY port is trying to send an OPEN frame if the incoming OPEN frame is higher priority.-->
