# Overview

SAS supports least-recently used arbitration fairness for connection requests.

# Description

- Each SAS port and expander port shall include an an Arbitration Wait Time timer that counts the time from the moment when the port makes a connection request until the request is accepted or rejected.
- The Arbitration Wait Time timer is in the port layer state machine ([7.2.2]()).
- The Arbitration Wait Time timer shall count in microseconds from 0 us to 32 767 us and in milliseconds from 32 768 us to 32 767 ms + 32 768 us. The Arbitration Wait Time timer shall stop incrementing when its value reaches 32 767 ms + 32 768 us.

## Starting Arbitration timer
- SAS port starts the arbitration timer when it transmit the first OPEN address frame for the connection request.
- When the SAS port retransmit the OPEN address frame (likely from losing arbitration and handling an inbound OPEN address frame), it will set the ARBITRATION WAIT TIME field to the current value of the Arbitration Wait Time timer.
