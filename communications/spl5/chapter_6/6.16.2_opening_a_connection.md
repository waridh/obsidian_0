# Connection request

The OPEN address frame is used to create a connection between the source PHY and the destination PHY (both of which are logical PHYs).
- The source PHY will transmit an OPEN address frame through an available logical PHY.
- after transmitting this OPEN address frame, the source PHY will transmit IDLE dwords until it receives a response.
- To prevent a deadlock, the source PHY will initialize a 1ms Open Timeout timer and start it.
	- If it receives an AIP, the timer will restart. This could repeat forever.
	- Whenever any connection response is received, the source PHY will reinitialize the Open Timeout timer.
	- If this timer expires, the source PHY will transmit a BREAK primitive sequence, and break the connection.
- If the OPEN address frame is sent through and expander, and that expander cannot forward the connection request, then the expander will return an OPEN_REJECT primitive.
- If the OPEN address frame reaches the destination, then the destination will respond with the OPEN_ACCEPT or OPEN_REJECT depending on what he destination decides.
	- This will not happen if arbitration occurred.
- Post connection, rate matching occurs.

## Wide ports
- A wide port will not attempt to make more connections with the destination port than there are PHYs in that destination, or the number of the narrowest pathway to the destination port.
