# APEGA Code of Ethics (Sped version)

## Overview

APEGA is the governing body of the province of Alberta, and all Engineers that operate out of it must follow the guidelines provided by the entity. Licensed engineers in the province must adhere by the Code of Ethics provided in order to uphold integrity, competence, dignity, and devotion to service.

### The Code of Ethics

#TODO: Need to finish studying for this one.

## Professions and Ethics

As society and technology evolves, so has ethics and the ways it can be applied.

### Profession and Self-Governance

Normally, a profession will require training, formal qualification, and specialized knowledge. These skills are paired with experience to service the following responsibilities:
- Render service based on advanced knowledge, skill, and judgement, which the public takes on trust
- is charged with substantive public obligation and serves the public interest
- Bound by a distinctive ethical code in its relationships with the public, clients, employers, and colleagues.

To be able to perform their duties, professionals must have the trust of their clients, employers, and the general public. To maintain this confidence, the professional must demonstrate both technical and ethical competence.

### Ethics

Ethics refers to the study of principles surrounding the conduct of individuals, and reflects the belief and system of the guideline about what is right or wrong. Ethics specifically deals with the actions on individuals with sufficient knowledge and options available to them.

In professional context, ethics applies to a set of values that guide the actions of individuals and organizations with regard to conduct and decision-making while carrying out professional duties and obligations.

Here are two ways that following the code of ethics shapes an individual's practice:
1. Adherence to the code of ethics provide a common set of values within the profession and thereby offers a reliable professional service to the public. Practising in a technically competent and ethical manner are two indivisible component vital to maintaining a relationship of trust within the profession and with the public in general.
2. In an increasingly technological world, the public is looking to licensed professionals to provide societal leadership. The professional relationship of trust is a fundamental element upon which licensed professionals do their part in guiding society to adopt technology for the advancement of public welfare.

### Excellence

The Government gave members of APEGA certain responsibility and privileges, and in return the public expects competencies in their practices (Along with ethical conduct).

## The Codes

There are five codes in the APEGA code of ethics
1. PENG in their practice, must hold paramount the health. safety and welfare of the public and have regard for the environment.
2. PENG shall only undertake work that they are competent to perform by virtue of their training and experience.
3. PENG shall conduct themselves with integrity, honesty, fairness, and objectivity in their professional activities.
4. PENG shall comply with applicable statutes, regulations, and bylaws in their professional practices.
5. PENG shall uphold and enhance the honour, dignity, and reputation of their professions and, thus, the ability of the professions to server the public interest.

## Commentary

### 1. Hold Paramount the Health, Safety, and Welfare of the public and have regard for the environment.

- You must put the health and safety of the public above all else. This must be done even if it goes against self interest.
- Ensure that the employer and the client be aware of societal and environmental impact of actions, and making sure to communicate this factually and objectively.
- The definition of public interest is not fixed as it evolves with society itself. To simplify the statement, make sure that people are not getting hurt, and actions that are being taken will not hurt people in the future.
- The workplace must be safe for workers as well. Both physical and psychological harm must be avoided.
- Whistleblowing must be done when an employer or client is putting the public interest at risk. If this code is being broken, it is the PENG duty to do some whistleblowing.
- You should keep track of the emerging technologies in your field and demonstrate due diligence.

### 2. Competence

- You should only undertake assignments, only when you are competent to do so. This is especially important if that task will put the public interest at risk when done poorly.
- You are also encouraged to take on new challenges and learn new skills while making sure that their employers and clients are aware of their current competency.
- You, your client, and your employer needs to know the scope of your responsibility. Write it down in a document.
- You cannot exaggerate your capability, and you must present yourself accurately. (Else you might break code 1).
- Providing advice can be dangerous. Only use your title when giving advice related to your own field. Do not give advice on a field that you are not competent in.
- Authentication and Validation. When you get your stamp, do not give it out without confirming that the work is up to standard, as you will be held responsible for any failures that comes under your name.
- Engage experts if you do not possess the qualifications to do a certain job.
- You need to maintain your competence in your area

### 3. Integrity, Honesty, Fairness, and Objectivity

- You need to document all errors or omissions. You should then communicate your findings to stakeholders.
- You should discuss with the employer and client about the risk inherent in the projects and how you should manage those risks.
- You should provide timely notification and advice to employers or clients when a project will not be successful.
- Make objective decision and examining the output of those decisions to ensure they uphold the respect and dignity of others and do not show favouritism.
- Upholding code 1 takes precedence over the interest of the client, or even the self.
- Before accepting assignments, you should inform both the employers and the client about any conflict of interest that you may have.
- Get rid of your bias.
- Careful when expression opinions in public, the title of engineer holds weight
- All information discussed between the client and the employer should be considered confidential and not be disclosed.
- Inform employers and clients the consequence of getting your recommendation overruled.
- Compensation for professional service 

### 4. Statutes, Regulations, and Bylaws

- Where ever you are working, you need to be aware of the engineering regulations there. 
- You also need to make sure that both the employer and the clients are aware of the law. You might have to whistle blow if they decide to not follow the law anyways.

### 5. Honour, Dignity, and Reputation

- **Uphold human rights**
- **Reconciliation**
- **Treat others well:** Conduct towards anyone involved in a respectful, courteous, and fair manner.
- **Reviewing the work of others:** Be sure to have all information before question the competency of another engineer, but also be sure to contact them if you find something you think is wrong with their work when reviewing.
- **Off-duty conduct:** Do not engage in activities that could discredit the profession.
